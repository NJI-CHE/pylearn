#operators are used to perform operations on variables
#They include; +,- ,*, /, =, %, **


#Arithmetic Operators
# +, -, *, /, %, **, //(floor multiplication)
#print(15//2)
#print(5%3)


#assignment Operators : They are used to assign values to variables
#x=5


#y+=3  # y=y+3
#x-=1  x=x-1


#Comparison Operators
# ==  x==y
# !=  x!=y   not equal
# > grater than
# < less than
# >= greater tahn or equal to
# <= less than or equal to


#Logical operators
# and  returns True if both statements are true
#x = 7
#print(x <5 and x < 10)

# or : returns true if one of the statements is true
#print(x<5 or x>3)

#not ; reverses the result,
#print(not(x<5 or x>3))

#Identity Operators
#is returns True if both variables are thesame object
# is not
#x=3
#y=3
#print(x is y)

#Membership operators
##used to test if a value exist in a sequence
b =["apple", "banana", 'Mango']
print("pear" not in b)
